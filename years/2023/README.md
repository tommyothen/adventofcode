# Advent of Code 2023

This is my repository for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. I'll be tackling each day's puzzles using 100% TypeScript, and documenting my solutions here.

## Quick Start

To run any of my solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tommyothen/adventofcode`
2. Navigate to the solution's directory.
3. Run the solution: `bun cli run 2023/01`
