# ðŸŽ„ Day 10 - Pipe Maze

*Solved on December 5th, 2024.*

[Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10) was definitely a hard one. Last year I wasn't even close to solving part 2, leaving a hilarious commit message optimistically stating "will complete part 2 in morning". One year later, I'm back and solved this problem in a reasonable amount of time. I'm very happy with the new results. I also rewrote the solution for part 1 to be a lot more efficient with a nice 29.43x speedup! From 8.34ms to 283.07Âµs.

## Results

| Part | Result | Average of 1000 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1    | 6956   | 274.96Âµs        |
| 2    | 455    | 852.61Âµs        |
