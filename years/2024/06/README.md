# ðŸŽ„ Day 6 - Guard Gallivant

[Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6), honestly this day shouldn't have taken me nearly as long as it did. I was fighting my part 2 for honestly way too long. I was sure the logic was right but I would always get a number that was way too high.

I came to the conclusion that sometimes it's better to start over than to keep trying to fix a bad solution. I started over and got it working in not long at all. The issue was that I was double counting walls that have already been done! Currently the solution is not the fastest at a staggering 247.22ms for part 2. I'm going to optimise it a bit more later today, I already have some easy wins in mind. Although, I really doubt I can get it to sub 1ms. So I'll be happy with it under 100ms.
