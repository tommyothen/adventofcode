# ðŸŽ„ Day 12 - Garden Groups

[Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/12) was all about finding shapes within a grid and finding the area, perimeter, and the number of sides the shape has. The first part was just working out the area and perimeter of the shapes which I found easy to implement with a recursive function. However, it took me a minute to figure out how I could determine the number of sides a shape has. I first tried to track the last cell and the sides on that until I had the brainwave that the amount of sides a shape has is the same as the amount of corners it has. So I can just check if it's a corner, and count those recursively too.

I think I've realised that my timing results function is a little inaccurate for timing the part 1 results, since my soltuion for both parts of today's challenge are exactly the same, using the exact same function. I think it's a startup time issue, but I'm not sure. I'll have to look into it. You can see this very clearly with the worst times displayed below.
