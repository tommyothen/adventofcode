# ðŸŽ„ Day 7 - Bridge Repair

Honestly, I thought [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7) would have been harder but it seems like it is an optimisation problem. I used a lot of precalculating, early exists and pruning to get the answers in a reasonable time. While my dreams of this year getting all solutions running under 1 millisecond are long gone because of these few past days, I am still happy with the results and my solutions. Again, maybe I will come back to this in the future to see if there was a smarter way to solve these under 1ms.
