# ðŸŽ„ Ceres Search

[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4), a nice puzzle still and I solved it relatively quickly. We needed to just search a 2D grid for specific patterns. I tackled it thinking similarly to finding words in a word search puzzle. There might be a blazingly obvious way to do it, but I'm happy with my solution. However, when writing part 1, I did assume that part 2 would be a simple extension of part 1 where we would have to search for different patterns and not just the one. That assumption wasn't exactly correct so my effort of writing a generic search function was not needed. I think if I were to come back to part 1, I would just hard code the search for the pattern we needed since I think it would be faster.

## Results

| Part | Result | Average of 1000 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1    | 2639   | 388.21Âµs        |
| 2    | 2005   | 190.07Âµs        |

## Revised Solution

As I wrote earlier, I would rewrite the part 1 solution to just search the next 3 cells after finding an "X". After implementing the solution and removing all recursion. I was able to get the average to a nice 388.21Âµs, down from 739.13Âµs. I also reworked the initial grid parsing to be more efficient, bringing part 2 down to 190.07Âµs from 221.19Âµs.
