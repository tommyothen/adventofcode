# ðŸŽ„ Day 9 - All in a Single Night

_Solved on December 10th, 2024._

[Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9) is about finding the shortest path between all locations. This wasn't too difficult, however I do think this can be optimised GREATLY. Right now, I'm generating all possible permutations of the locations and then calculating the distance for each permutation. This is a brute force approach and I'm sure there's a better way to do this, however right now I'm just trying to complete all of 2015's puzzles.
