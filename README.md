# 🎄 Advent of Code

Welcome to my repository where I tackle the exciting challenges from Advent of Code using TypeScript, particularly with the Bun runtime. Here, you'll find my journey through these puzzles, focusing on clean and efficient solutions. 🚀

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language you like. I've chosen TypeScript for its familiarity and robust features.

After an initial attempt with Rust in 2022, I've shifted my focus solely to problem-solving rather than language learning. TypeScript, being my comfort zone, allows me to dive deeper into the intricacies of each problem.

## Repository Structure 📁

- Each year's challenges are neatly organized in their respective directories under `years`.
- Solutions for each day are placed in corresponding folders, e.g., `./years/2023/01/`.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine as this project uses Bun's runtime.

### Running Solutions

Navigate to the repository's root and use the custom CLI to manage and run solutions:

- **Run Solution**: `bun cli run` or `bun cli r` - Executes the solution for the current day.
- **Create New Solution**: `bun cli create` or `bun cli c` - Sets up a new solution for the current day.
- **Help**: `bun cli --help` or `bun cli -h` - Displays the help message.

To run tests, simply use the native `bun test` command.
